This is the new version (bugfix + password protected) of <b>anknotes</b>, the <b>evernote importer</b>.
How to use it :
<ol>
<li>In Tools > Preferences, go to the evernote tab and enter the tag of evernote notes you want to import. You can enter multiple tags by separating with a comma (ex : tag1,tag2).</li>
<li>You can also specify the deck in which the cards will be imported, as well as a tag that will be added to these cards.</li>
<li>When it's done, you can click on tools>import for evernote. The first time you click on it, you will have to follow the instructions to give access to your evernote access. To protect the token you were given, the application will ask you to set a password. Don't forget it as you will be asked this password each time you click on "import from evenote"</li>
</ol>
 If you encounter an issue, please use the <a href="https://github.com/brumar/anknotes/issues">dedicated tool of github</a>, where the source code of this addon lives. As far as I remember, and if nothing changed, I am not alerted of the reviews that are written on this page.

Last note, if you (as I did) use this plug-in as a trick to get a dedicated clipping tool for anki into your browser, maybe you will have interest in <a href="https://github.com/brumar/anki-monkey">this script I wrote.</a>
